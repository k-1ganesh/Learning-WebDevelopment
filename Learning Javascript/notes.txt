Everything happens in JS inside execution context.
Execution context has 2 phases : i) Memory Allocation ii) Code Execution. 
i) Memory Allocation : In this phase memory gets allocated to the variables and the functions. var : undefined  ,  function : fun(...) 
ii) Code Execution : In this code execution starts. 

for every function call function execution context gets created and pushed into the call stack. 

Hoisting : Using varible and functions before their declaration. For function and var variables it will work. For let and const it will give error. 

Scope in Javascript : variable is first searched in local scope of function . If not there then outer function . If not there then its outer function. 
                      This chain is called scope chain. 

Do the let and const gets Hoisted : Yes they gets hoisted but they can't be accesssed before initialization else reference error will be thrown. 

Temporal Dead Zone : It is a time period from let and const getting hoisted to the the initialization. 

Block Scope : {} This is a block .  let and const inside this block are the block scoped varibles.  They exist only inside this block. 

Closure : Closures are the functions which remembers the environment in which they are created.
          This means that an inner function can access the variables of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.   

Asynchronous Javascript : By default JS is synchronous but it can be made asynchronous using (Browser API / Web API) .
What are Web API : These are the set of functions provided by browsers to help js make pages interactive. 
e.g ( setTimeout , setInterval , DOM API , fetch() , localStorage ) 

How JS execute Asynchronous Code ? 
=> Whenever Asynchronous code is there its callback gets registered in browser. Consider e.g of setTimeout and callback will execute after 1 second. So when the call back gets registered browser will start the timer. In mean time JS will be keep executing the normal code synchronously. When the timer expires that callback function gets placed in the CALLBACK QUEUE. EVENT LOOP will place the call back function in CALLSTACK when call stack is empty. 

Event Loop : It is a mechanism which is responsible for async JS. Its job is to place the call back functions from CALLBACK QUEUE or MICROTASK QUEUE to CALLSTACK. 

MicroTask Queue : It also has the callback functions of promises. It has more priority than the callback queue .
